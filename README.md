## ⚙️ Step 1 – Dual Boot Your System with Ubuntu

To begin this project, you must have **Ubuntu** installed on your system.  
If you haven’t already, please **dual boot** your system with Ubuntu (you can use any version like Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later).

You can find detailed tutorials online(resources shared), but here are the key steps:
1. Back up your data.
2. Create a bootable USB with Ubuntu.
3. Shrink your Windows partition to make free space.
4. Boot from USB → Install Ubuntu alongside Windows.
5. Complete installation and reboot.

Once you’ve successfully booted into Ubuntu — move to Step 2.

🔹 You need to:
- Go through the commands listed in the docs.
- Execute each task in your Ubuntu terminal.
- Take **screenshots of the outputs** and/or **scripts** where mentioned.

✅ Make sure your screenshots clearly show the commands and their results.

##  Step 3 – Prepare Your Submission

## Submission Guidelines (Important)

Each mentee must **fork this repository** and upload their work inside their fork.  

###  Steps to Submit:

1️⃣ **Fork this repo**  
Go to 👉 [https://github.com/Ankitaashok20/Trap_Shield_Learning_Phase](https://github.com/Ankitaashok20/Trap_Shield_Learning_Phase)  
Click the **“Fork”** button (top-right).  
This will create a copy under your GitHub account.

2️⃣ **Open your forked repo**  

3️⃣ **Add your submission**  
- Go to your fork → click **Add file → Upload files** (or drag-drop).
- Create your folder as:
-submissions/<your-name>/task1/
- Create a doc of you screenshots, scripts, and output and upload that.

4️⃣ **Commit your changes**  
- Add a short commit message like:
-Task 1 submission by <your-name>
- Click **Commit changes**

No need to send any link or PR.  
Your work will be visible automatically under your fork.

## ⚠️General Instructions
- Make sure your **folder names match your name exactly**.
- Keep your repo public so the mentor can view it.
- Do **not** modify or delete other mentees’ folders (everyone works in their own fork).
- Ensure your screenshots are clearly visible.
